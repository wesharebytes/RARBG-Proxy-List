Alternatively, I recommend using Google or Cloudflare DNS. These are provided free of charge by companies and can be used by anyone.


How to change your DNS;

Go to your network settings and click on "Network Connections".

Right-click the connection you are using to access the Internet and choose Properties.

Select Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP / IPv4) and click Properties.

At the bottom of the window, select "Use the following DNS server addresses".

To change the DNS settings, you need to enter two of them. If you want to use Google DNS, enter **8.8.8.8** and **8.8.4.4**. If you prefer Cloudflare, enter **1.1.1.1** and **1.0.0.1**.
