# Can't unblock RARBG
If you find that RARBG is active and you still cannot access it, don't worry. You can unlock RARBG with a few simple steps. All you have to do is change your DNS provider. By default, most users use a DNS that has been preset by their ISP. However, this can be changed easily and free of charge.

Alternatively, I recommend using Google or Cloudflare DNS. These are provided free of charge by companies and can be used by anyone.


How to change your DNS;

Go to your network settings and click on "Network Connections".

Right-click the connection you are using to access the Internet and choose Properties.

Select Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP / IPv4) and click Properties.

At the bottom of the window, select "Use the following DNS server addresses".

To change the DNS settings, you need to enter two of them. If you want to use Google DNS, enter **8.8.8.8** and **8.8.4.4**. If you prefer Cloudflare, enter **1.1.1.1** and **1.0.0.1**.


# How do I know if a proxy site is safe to use?

Determining the security of a proxy site involves taking several factors into account. While I cannot guarantee the absolute security of any particular proxy, here are some guidelines to help you evaluate whether a proxy site is trustworthy:

#### Source and reputation:
Check the proxy source. Is this recommended by reliable tech forums or communities? Avoid using proxies from unverified sources.
Look for user reviews. If other users have had positive experiences with the proxy, this is a good sign.

#### Security Features:
Does the proxy site use HTTPS (secure browsing)? A secure connection ensures that your data remains encrypted while in transit.
Some proxy servers offer additional security features such as ad blocking, malware protection, or cookie management. This may improve security.

#### Privacy Policy and Data Processing:
Check if the proxy site has a privacy policy. It should state how they process user data.
Avoid proxy servers that log your online activity or share your data with third parties.

#### Popups and redirects:
Be careful if the proxy server bombards you with pop-up ads or redirects. Excessive advertising may indicate an unsafe site.

#### Avoid suspicious domains:
If a proxy site's domain looks suspicious (such as random letters, numbers, or misspellings), it's best to avoid it.
 
#### Test the proxy server:
Use a proxy for simple searches or visit a confidential website. Observe his work and behavior.
If it redirects you to unrelated sites or displays intrusive ads, consider it unsafe.

#### Instead, use a reliable VPN:
Consider using a virtual private network (VPN) instead of a proxy. VPNs provide better security, privacy and anonymity.
Reliable VPN services such as NordVPN, ExpressVPN or Surfshark are reliable options.

Please remember that using a proxy always carries some risk. If you access sensitive information or participate in activities where privacy is important, consider investing in a reliable VPN service for better protection. Be careful and prioritize your online safety!
